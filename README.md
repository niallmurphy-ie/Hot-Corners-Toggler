# Hot Corners Toggler for OSX

##### Disable and enable hot corners from the menu bar.

## How does it work?

This small application uses shell commands to get and set hot corners. To apply changes, the OSX Dock application must be restarted, which is why the bar flashes when changes are applied.

## Note

I don't work with OSX and only built this because Hot Corners activating during games were stopping me from playing. I won't be paying $99/year to Apple to sign this app. I'd be happy for someone to collaborate and sign releases of this.

## How to use

1. Download the latest release from the releases tab.
2. Unzip the file and drag the app to your Applications folder.
3. Right click the app and click open.
4. Click the icon in the menu bar and select to Disable or Enable hot corners.
5. Add the app as a login item to have it start on boot.

Or build it yourself from the source here.
